Solana Wallet Hub
A React-based Solana wallet interface that enables users to interact with the Solana blockchain. This app provides a simple yet powerful toolkit for connecting a Solana wallet, requesting test SOL tokens from the Devnet, viewing balances, signing messages, and transferring SOL tokens. Built using the Solana Wallet Adapter, it demonstrates the essential functionalities for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

Project Overview
Solana Wallet Hub is designed as a straightforward, user-friendly wallet interface for the Solana blockchain. Using this application, users can:

Connect and disconnect their Solana wallet.
Request test SOL tokens from the Devnet (for testing and development).
View their wallet's SOL balance.
Sign custom messages using their wallet's private key.
Send SOL tokens to other wallets.
This project can serve as a foundation for developers looking to build blockchain wallets, integrate with decentralized applications, or learn about blockchain technology on Solana.

Tech Stack
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Solana Wallet Adapter: Library to simplify wallet connection and transactions on the Solana blockchain.
Solana Web3.js: JavaScript SDK to interact with the Solana blockchain.
Noble Ed25519: Cryptographic library for verifying digital signatures.
BS58: Base58 encoding/decoding library, useful for handling wallet public keys.

Features
Connect/Disconnect Wallet: Users can connect to their Solana wallet using WalletMultiButton and disconnect with WalletDisconnectButton.
Request Airdrop: Allows users to request test SOL tokens from the Solana Devnet to their connected wallet.
Show Balance: Displays the SOL balance of the connected wallet.
Sign Message: Allows users to sign messages with their wallet’s private key. It generates a cryptographic signature for message verification.
Send Tokens: Users can transfer SOL tokens to other wallets.

Explanation of Key Components
RequestAirdrop.js: Requests SOL tokens from the Solana Devnet faucet.
ShowSolBalance.js: Displays the SOL balance of the connected wallet.
SignMessage.js: Signs a message using the connected wallet’s private key and verifies the signature.
SendTokens.js: Transfers a specified amount of SOL tokens from the connected wallet to another wallet.

Usage
Connecting the Wallet: Use the "Connect Wallet" button to connect to your Solana wallet.
Requesting an Airdrop: Enter the amount of SOL you want to request (in SOL, not lamports) and click "Request Airdrop" to receive test tokens.
Viewing Balance: The SOL balance of the connected wallet is displayed below the Airdrop section.
Signing a Message: Enter a message and click "Sign Message" to sign it with your wallet. This generates a digital signature.
Sending SOL Tokens: Specify a wallet address in the "To" field and an amount in the "Amount" field, then click "Send" to transfer SOL tokens.
